# For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle.
# Then I created a table to insert Spotify data into.
# Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL. 

#Creating the table: 
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL 
)

#Then I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table.

#Next, I explored the data using the following SQL.

#1. What are the top 10 most popular songs?
SELECT artist_name, track_name, popularity
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY popularity DESC
LIMIT 10;

#2. Which artist had the longest song, and what was that song?
SELECT artist_name, track_name, duration_ms
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY duration_ms DESC
LIMIT 1;

#3. What are the 5 artists that had the highest danceability, and what are the energy levels of those?
SELECT artist_name, danceability, energy
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
ORDER BY danceability ASC
LIMIT 5;

#4. What are the 5 artists that had the lowest danceability, and what are the energy levels of those?
SELECT artist_name, danceability, energy
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
ORDER BY danceability DESC
LIMIT 5;

#5. What is the average danceability of the top 10 most popular songs?
SELECT AVG(danceability) AS avg_danceability
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
WHERE track_name IN (
  SELECT track_name 
  FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
  ORDER BY popularity DESC
  LIMIT 10);

#6. Who are the top 5 artists with the most songs in the top 50?
SELECT artist_name, COUNT(artist_name)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
ORDER BY COUNT(artist_name) DESC
LIMIT 5;

#7. What is the average tempo for all of the Olivia Rodrigo songs?
SELECT AVG(tempo)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
WHERE artist_name="Olivia Rodrigo";

#8. What is the quietest song?
SELECT track_name, artist_name, MIN(loudness)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata;

#9. What are the 5 loudest songs, and what is their danceability?
SELECT track_name, artist_name, loudness, danceability
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY loudness DESC
LIMIT 5;
